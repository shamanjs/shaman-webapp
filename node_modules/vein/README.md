Vein uses ES5 features so be sure to include es5shim on your page.

## Example

### Server

```javascript
var Vein = require('vein');
var server = http.createServer().listen(8080);
var vein = Vein.createServer({server: server});

vein.add('multiply', function (res, numOne, numTwo){
  res.reply(numOne * numTwo);
});
```

### Client

```javascript
var vein = Vein.createClient();
vein.on('ready', function (services){
  vein.multiply(2, 5, function (num){
    // num === 10
  });
});
```

## Server Usage

### Create

```
-- Options --
server - required, the http server to hook
resource - change to allow multiple servers on one port (default: "default")
```

```javascript
var Vein = require('vein');
var vein = Vein.createServer({options});
```

### Adding services

Arguments passed to res.reply() will be applied to the callback on the client

```javascript
vein.add('getNumber', function (res, name, num) {
  res.reply("Hey there " + name + " I got your number " + num);
});
```

### Middleware

You can use middleware to add layers in front of your services. Any arguments passed into next will be thrown as an error on the client and end the middleware chain.

```javascript
vein.use(function(req, res, next){
  if (req.service == 'login') {
    next();
  } else {
    if (res.cookie('login') == 'success!') {
      next();
    } else {
      res.disconnect();
    }
  }
});
```

### Testing

Vein supports calling the res object as a function. This makes it easier to integrate vanilla-JS services into vein. The only difference is that you still have to put the callback first (this is to prevent headaches with variable arguments from the client).

```javascript
vein.add('echoUser', function (res, username, password) {
  res(username, password);
});
```

## Client Usage

### Create

```
-- Options --
host - server location (default: window.location.hostname)
port - server port (default: window.location.port)
secure - use SSL (default: window.location.protocol)
resource - change to allow multiple servers on one port (default: "default")
```

```javascript
var vein = Vein.createClient({options});
```

### Ready

When the connection has been established your callback will be called with an array of services available.

```javascript
vein.on('ready', function (services) {
  //Start doing stuff!
});
```

### Calling services

When calling a service the format is vein.serviceName(args..., callback)

```javascript
vein.getNumber('john', 2, function (msg) {
  console.log(msg);
});
```
  
### Cookies

You can read/write cookies by using vein.cookie(). This is just nice sugar.

```javascript
vein.cookie('test', 'hello world'); //write
console.log(vein.cookie('test')); //read
vein.cookie('test', null); //delete
```
  
### Close

If the connection has been closed this will be called.

```javascript
vein.on('close', function (reason) {
  console.log("Connection lost due to", reason);
});
```
